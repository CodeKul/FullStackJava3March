4) 1. A VotingApp needs to develop an online application for two types of users, Adults and children.
   Both of these users should be able to register an account. Any user who is less than 12 years
   of age will be registered as a child and they cannot go for voting, whereas an adult can but only
   once.
   Note: In future, more users/roles might be added to the App where similar rules will
   been forced. Develop Interfaces and classes for the categories mentioned above.
   a. Create an interface VotingApp with the following methods declared
   Method Name:
   registerUser
   requestVotingNumber
   The methods in the Kids class should perform the following logic.
   i.
   registerUser : if age < 12, a message displaying “You have successfully registered
   under Kids” should be displayed in the console.
   If(age>12), a message displaying, “You have not successfully registered” should be
   displayed in the console.
   e. requestVotingNumber: if voting Type is “Kids”, a message displaying “Sorry cannot go for
   voting because Age must be greater than 12 to vote” should be displayed in the console
   The methods in the Adult class should perform the following logic.
   i.
   registerUser : if age > 12, a message displaying“ You have successfully
   registered under an Adult” should be displayed in the console.
   If age<12, a message displaying, “You have not successfully registered under an Adult” should
   be displayed in the console.
   ii.
   requestVotingNumber: if voting Type is “Adult”, a message displaying “Your
   voting Id will be generated within a day “should be displayed in the console.
   else, a message displaying, “Oops, you are not” should be displayed in the console.
   f.
   Create a class “VotingAppDemo.java” with a main method which performs
   the functions

5) WRITE A PROGRAM to create Package arithmetic having classes Addition, Subtraction, Division
   ,Multiplication with appropriate methods .Use this Classes outside the package.
