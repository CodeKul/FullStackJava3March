1)    Write a program to illustrate the concept of containment:
        a) Create a class Author with the following:
        i) Data Members: authorName,age,place.
        ii) Constructor with arguments to initialize the variables.
        iii)Use getter methods to get values.
        b) Create class Book with the following:
        i) Data Members:name,price,Author
        ii) Constructor with args to initialize the variables.
        iii)Create method showDetails() to display the details.

2)    Write a program to illustrate the concept of containment:
      a) Create a class Address with the following:
      i) Data Members: streetNo.,city, state, country.
      ii) Constructor with arguments to initialize the variables.
      b) Create class Person with the following:
      i) Data Members:PName, PAdhaarNo.,PJobName,PJobId,PJobLocation
      ii) Constructor with args to initialize the variables.
      iii)Create Address object as a member of Person class.
      iv)Create method displayPersonDetails() to display the details of person.
      c) Create a class college
      i) Data Members: collegeName,Address collegeAddress.
      ii) Constructor with arguments to initialize the variables
      iii) Create method displayCollegeDetails() to display the details of college
      d) Create a class Staff
      i) Data Members: employeeName,Address employeeAddress.
      ii) Constructor with arguments to initialize the variables
      iii) Create method displayStaffDetails() to display the details of staff

3)  Why java does not support multiple inheritance?


4) 1. A VotingApp needs to develop an online application for two types of users, Adults and children.
   Both of these users should be able to register an account. Any user who is less than 12 years
   of age will be registered as a child and they cannot go for voting, whereas an adult can but only
   once.
   Note: In future, more users/roles might be added to the App where similar rules will
   been forced. Develop Interfaces and classes for the categories mentioned above.
   a. Create an interface VotingApp with the following methods declared
   Method Name:
   registerUser
   requestVotingNumber
   The methods in the Kids class should perform the following logic.
   i.
   registerUser : if age < 12, a message displaying “You have successfully registered
   under Kids” should be displayed in the console.
   If(age>12), a message displaying, “You have not successfully registered” should be
   displayed in the console.
   e. requestVotingNumber: if voting Type is “Kids”, a message displaying “Sorry cannot go for
   voting because Age must be greater than 12 to vote” should be displayed in the console
   The methods in the Adult class should perform the following logic.
   i.
   registerUser : if age > 12, a message displaying“ You have successfully
   registered under an Adult” should be displayed in the console.
   If age<12, a message displaying, “You have not successfully registered under an Adult” should
   be displayed in the console.
   ii.
   requestVotingNumber: if voting Type is “Adult”, a message displaying “Your
   voting Id will be generated within a day “should be displayed in the console.
   else, a message displaying, “Oops, you are not” should be displayed in the console.
   f.
   Create a class “VotingAppDemo.java” with a main method which performs
   the functions

5) WRITE A PROGRAM to create Package arithmetic having classes Addition, Subtraction, Division
   ,Multiplication with appropriate methods .Use this Classes outside the package.


   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   File Handling

   1 . create a file Object eg. File file = new File("nameOfFile")
        1. check whether file is exist or not (use exists() method of file)
        2. check path and absolute path(print the path)
        3. check  whether the file is writable (use canWrite())
        4. check  whether the file is readable (use canRead())
        5. print length of the file in bytes(use length())

   2 . create a pdf file and write a data into a file


String and Collection =>

   1 . get input from user of string and reverse the string

   2. Write a program to remove all the duplicate characters from a given input String,
   like, if the given String is "Java" then the output should be "Java".
   The second or further occurrence of duplicates should be removed.

   3. How to check if two given String is the anagram of each other?

   4. How do you check if a given String is Palindrome or not?

   5. Write a program to count a number of words in a given String.
    The words are separated by the following characters: space (‘ ‘) or newline (‘\n’) or tab (‘\t’) or a combination of these.
    For example, if input "Java is great" your program should print 3.
